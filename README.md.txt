3. Load: Loaded the cleaned dataset into a MySQL database (student_db).

 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy, MySQL Connector)
- Jupyter Notebook
- MySQL Workbench
- GitHub for version control

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open ETL_student_project.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Update your MySQL credentials in the connection code.
4. Run each cell step by step.
